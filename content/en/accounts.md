## Let's get started

We will be discussing how to use the [Polkadot.JS UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts) system to create and manage accounts that will be associated with a "soft wallet" or "JSON Wallet" as well as the hardware token device, the Ledger. 

This guide assumes you have prior knowledge of Polkadot or Kusama staking and nominating concepts, if you don't please read our short [Staking Guide](staking)

### What's in this guide:

* Understanding accounts on Polkadot/Kusama
* Installing the Polkadot{.js} extension for Chrome or Firefox/Brave
* Creating separate Stash and Controller accounts using the extension
* Optional: Use a Ledger as your Stash account

## Accounts

This section will be used to explain what an account is, how they are created, how we backup our accounts/wallets and secure them with a hardware device, and how we will name our accounts to use later when nominating a validator node for staking.

More information can be found on the [Polkadot Accounts](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-accounts) wiki page.

### What is an account anyways?

* An account is a cryptographic 'private key'
* Accounts are generated using mnemonics from 12-24 words
* Passwords are used to protect your account/wallet
* Use a hardware wallet such as a ledger for better security

An account or wallet are ways to describe your private key. Private keys are unique and can be generated by anyone using software programmed with the corresponding algorithm. When we create accounts in Polkadot or Kusama we are creating them based on a 24-word mnemonic. These mnemonics can be saved in a secure and safe place, off-line, such as a safety deposit box, in the event that you ever need to recover your account, you can easily do so with this information.

More information can be found on the [Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-accounts)

### Types of Accounts

We need to create two accounts to nominate a validator node and participate in the staking process. They will be the same wallet types/formats, except we will give them distinct names or labels so they are easy to discern between.

#### Stash account

A **stash account** is the primary account that will hold your funds. Funds can be kept in a cold wallet and will be ***bonded*** and locked for 28 days before they can be accessed.

#### Controller account

Your **controller account** is a separate account used to control and perform staking commands for your stash account, such as selecting validator nodes to nominate, and starting/stopping nominating.

### `Polkadot{.js}` Browser Plugin

The official Polkadot{.js} plugin is supported by the W3F Foundation and provides a reasonable balance of security and usability, allowing users a local mechanism to generate addresses (wallets) and interact with Polkadot.

[Brave and Firefox plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-extension)

After installing the plugin, you should see the orange and white Polkadot logo in the menu bar of your browser

### Create a 'Stash' account

#### Open Accounts

Navigate to [Polkadot Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps). Click on the "Accounts" tab

#### Create Account

Open the Polkadot{.js} browser extension by clicking the logo on the top bar of your browser. You will see a browser pop-up.

![Add Account - Polkadot{.js} screenshot](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/assets/accounts/polkadot_plugin_js_new_01.png)

Click on the plus button or select "**Create new account**" from the small plus icon in the top right. The Polkadot{.js} plugin will create a new seed/wallet for you and display your 12-word mnemonic. This can be used to recreate your account/private key and should be written down and stored securely.

Store and secure these words properly, it is imperative to store the seed somewhere safe, secret, and secure. If you cannot access your account via Polkadot{.js}, you can re-enter your seed through the "Add account menu" by selecting "Import account from pre-existing seed".

#### Account Name

Assign this account the name 'Stash' for staking purposes

#### Account Password

This password will be used to encrypt and decrypt the account's information. You will need to use this password for any kind of outgoing transaction or when using it to cryptographically sign a message.

### Create a 'Controller' account

Repeat the same process for the 'Stash' account, except give this account a different name, like 'Controller'. 

## Using the Polkadot Ledger Application

### Requirements

* Chromium-based browser like Brave and Chrome (webusb)
* Compatible with Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X devices
* App available for Kusama as well

### Installing Ledger Application

#### Using Ledger Live

* Open the **Manager** tab in Ledger Live
* Connect and unlock your Ledger device
* If asked, allow the manager on your device by pressing both buttons on the YES screen
* Install the Polkadot application from the App Catalog

### Using your Ledger on Polkadot-JS Apps

#### Loading your Account

Before you can use your Ledger with the Polkadot{.js} Apps UI you will need to make a settings change in the [Polkadot Apps UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/settings).

* Change option from "Do not attach Ledger devices" to "**Attach Ledger via WebUSB**" (must be using Chrome)

  ![Attach Ledger via WebUSB screenshot](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/assets/ledger.png)

  

* Click "Save" to keep your settings

Now when you navigate to the "Accounts" tab you will see a new button that says "Add Ledger". Make sure your Ledger is unlocked and not in the screensaver mode.

![Add via Ledger button screenshot](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/assets/ledger/query-ledger.png)

A pop will appear asking you to give a name to an account on the ledger or choose a different account on your ledger.

* 0/0 is good for your first account
* 0/1 might be your second account

You should be able to see your account in the list with the type "ledger"

## Conclusion

We have just created a Stash account, a Controller account, and we have also learned how to create accounts on the 'Ledger' secure hardware wallet.
